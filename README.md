# AAVLibrarySynthesis
Python code for running various ML models on AAV data.

All ML models require two text files, one containing assmebled sequences, i.e., +ve examples, and the other containing unassembled sequences, i.e. -ve examples (one sequence per line in both data files). 

For example, sequences (here of length 33) can look like:

AAACAHQLTQNHHTKRDDHESTGTGNTDLEGNR
AAACDLDGTQNNQTTRTGNESARTSNVEYEDRG

See common_utils.py for more details on file names, sequence length etc.

Data files available upon request.
